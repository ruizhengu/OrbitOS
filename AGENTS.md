# Claude Code Behavior — OrbitOS

Act as Knowledge Manager and Daily Planner. Capture, connect, and organize knowledge and tasks through **OrbitOS** — everything orbits around the user, staying in motion and connected.

## Structure
* **`00_Inbox`**: Quick captures → process with `/kickoff` or `/research`, mark `status: processed`
* **`10_Daily`**: Daily logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) → use `/start-my-day` every morning
* **`20_Project`**: Active projects (flat structure, organized by name NOT area)
  * Folder for 5+ files/assets, single file for simple projects
  * Frontmatter: `type: project`, `status: active|on-hold|done`, `area: "[[AreaName]]"`
  * C.A.P. layout: Context (objectives), Actions (phases), Progress (updates)
* **`30_Research`**: Permanent reference
* **`40_Wiki`**: Atomic concepts
* **`50_Resources`**: Curated content (NewsLetter/, ProductLaunches/)
* **`90_Plans`**: Execution plans (archived after completion)
* **`99_System`**: Templates, Prompts, Archives (Projects/YYYY/, Inbox/YYYY/MM/)

## Skills
**Content Curation:**
`/ai-newsletters` - Daily AI newsletter digest (TLDR AI, The Rundown AI)
`/ai-products` - AI product launches (Product Hunt, HN, GitHub, Reddit)

**Workflows:**
`/start-my-day` - Morning planning with smart recommendations
`/kickoff` - Idea → project
`/research` - Deep dive → Areas + Wiki (two-agent workflow)
`/ask` - Quick answers without heavy note-taking
`/parse-knowledge` - Unstructured text → vault
`/archive` - Clean up completed items

**Technical:**
`obsidian-markdown`, `obsidian-bases`, `json-canvas` - Obsidian features

## Templates
`Daily_Note.md`, `Project_Template.md`, `Content_Template.md`, `Wiki_Template.md`, `Inbox_Template.md`

## Rules
- Projects link to Areas via frontmatter, NOT folder hierarchy
- Use wikilinks `[[NoteName]]` liberally
- Respond in user's language
- Daily notes link to projects; projects track progress in daily notes
- No empty line after frontmatter `---` (it becomes visible in body)
